# Enhanced Cursor Reactivity with 3D Effect

## Overview

This project showcases an interactive web experience that enhances cursor reactivity with a 3D effect, simulating eye movement. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create dynamic eye movements based on the user's cursor position.

## Features

- Eye Tracking: The website features two eyes that follow the user's cursor movement, giving the impression of interactive eye tracking.
  
- Pupil Movement: Additionally, the pupils within the eyes react to cursor movement, creating a more immersive 3D effect.

## Usage

To view the website in action:

1. Clone the repository.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/ADISHA2003/3D-GazeTracker.git
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
